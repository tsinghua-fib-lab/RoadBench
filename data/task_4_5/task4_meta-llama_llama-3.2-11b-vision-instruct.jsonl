Instead, the image contains a dividing line that makes it a travel lane. There are also two apparent wide white lines on the right that indicate this lane is a turning lane. Looking ahead down the road, there are three lanes visible. There are two on each side of the dividing line, which appears to be made of curbing that extends across the width of the trunk road section and comes to a point. It seems likely the left sides of both the upper white lines are also curbing and form this defined area that spans the connected horizontal left white line. This makes three lanes total in this direction. The default-side-setting image varies from this assumption as the middle lane sets the standard that contains curbing.

{"id": "adf5a3fcad6f47d88bd0979fc21207ec", "answer": "**Step 1: Analyze the Image**\nThe image shows a road with multiple lanes. We can see two distinct sections separated by a center bar. The left half has four or five lanes, while the right half appears to have three or four lanes.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Number of Lanes**\nOn the left side, there are three more lanes next to the blue symbol on the road. On the right side, there are four or five lanes present. However, as the direction of traffic is on the right side of the road, the left side lanes will not be used for incoming traffic, and the two-inch center lane appears to be a shoulder for dividing traffic. Therefore, when following the traffic direction, we should only count the right side lanes. The second rightmost space appears visually short, indicating it might be a right-turning lane or space not available for vehicles driving in the given direction. By counting the spaces, including this visual space, we estimate there to be a total of six lanes available on this road for vehicles driving in the direction shown, excluding bicycles and cars on the left side of the road. This appears to be an overcount, as counting six would assume that several people are parked to accommodate their activities.\n\n**Step 3: Final Decision and Explanation**\nBased on visual assessment, the road appears to have four lanes going in the direction of the road, from our perspective in the photo. This appears to be a more suitable number.\n\n**Final Output**\n```yaml\n# Explanation: There are four lanes available for vehicles traveling in the direction of the road.

The road is divided into three different lanes.\n\n**Step 2: Lane Analysis**\n\nThe leftmost lane is for vehicles heading the opposite direction of the captured image.

The farthest marking from the driver is representative of the change lane just before the traffic light. Since there are 3 markings visible (1, _central grass area_, 3), and the driver is in the **rightmost** lane, three is visible and will be the number of lanes available.\n3.  **Determine the number of lanes**.

The central lane has a solid white line separating it from the right-hand lane. Additionally, there are markings for traffic islands (two in the image section) and raised concrete barriers to their immediate left (yet out of frame).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Lanes\n\nConsidering only the lanes that doubtless exist and are visible in the image, there appears to be **two** lanes available for vehicles traveling in the direction of the road.\n\n### Step 3: Ensure Reasonableness and Yam Out\n\nEnsure that the answer is reasonable by verifying the road's physical and practical capabilities that would support the number of lanes identified.\n\n### Step 4: Write Code to Embed Response\n\nSince you didn't provide any specifics on where I should embed code or such.
